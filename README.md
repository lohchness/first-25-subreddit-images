# first-25-subreddit-images
Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) to grab images from the hot section of a given subreddit. Great for cat pics.

This is intended to be a private program, since it needs my account details as well as keys to my app in the Reddit API. You *can* try to change the variables such as the password as well as the keys around to your own ones, though (they are in external txt file to be read - will not be included in the code). Included below will be video demonstration of the program.

However if you do intend to download and use the code, you will need to install PRAW and urllib.
